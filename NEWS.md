The following new features and bug fixes are applied:
- one metric is added: the cyclomatic metric of McCabe (see paper for more information)
- the way path logs are calculated is improved in order that the function will not get stuck in an infinite loop
- time limits are added to the creation and generation of path logs
- the function parameters are made more user-friendly
- functions are added to check whether relations are present in the model such as a directly follows relationship
